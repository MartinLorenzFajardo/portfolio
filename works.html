            <h3>Game Development: "Project Anatomy"</h3>
            <p>Project Anatomy is a group project by CHAMPORADO for our Specialized Subject in Grade 12. We successfully created an Educational Platformer-RPG game with the theme of health.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Language / Sofware: </b>Construct 3</p>
            <p><b>Role: </b>Artist, Programmer, Researcher</p>
            <p>Our group was divided into 2, programmers and the researchers. The programmers will create the game while the researchers will create the Research Paper. (It was a 2 project in 1)</p>
            <p>
              Project Anatomy's Idea is that a doctor in the future was able to make a ground breaking discovery that could help fight diseases. It was the Shrinking Technology. He managed to Shrinking
              himself and get inside the patient's body where he will eradicate the disease from within. The game consists of 5 levels each getting harder and harder the higher your level is.

          <h3>Web Development: "FlixPlus"</h3>
          <p>
            FlixPlus is a group task by PANDABOYZ during our Work Immersion in Grade 12. We created a Movie Recommendation Website that also functions as a forum for every movie enjoyer to
            participate on.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p><b>Method: </b>React, Bootstrap</p>
          <p><b>Role: </b>Front-End and Back-End Developer</p>
          <p>Our group was divided into 2, Front-Ends and Back-Ends. I was part of the Front-End group (with the Back-Ends having different task) but our task also involves back-end.</p>
          <p>
            The idea behind FlixPlus is that we were asked by the Interns what type of website we would like to create in learning React and Bootstrap. We all agreed to make a website about Movies.
            The website's navigation is functional but it was never launched online. We used Git and Github to work separately on different parts of the website and was able to run the website locally.
            Sadly, our Work Immersion ended before we can fully complete the website.
